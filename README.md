# datajam_Mars_MajorElements

datajam Mars MajorElements Parallel Sets Python Plotly

## What is this?
The results of a data jam run by Houston Data Visualization meetup. 

## When?
3-4 Houston Saturday July 22nd, 2017

## What 
Major element data from all ChemCam rock sample data from start of MarsScienceLaboratory (Curiosity Rover) till today. 

## Purpose
Wanted to interactively view ratios of different oxides and view every sample but also view clusters within the whole. 

## Used
Used pandas and plot.ly using the python language and built in the Jupyter notebook


## Result

The pink bits on the image above are dragable and expandable "brushes". The samples "brushed" are colored but the ones that are not appear gray. This provides a way to see clusters within the whole, which is messy. 

## Future work
This can be redone in Tableau, which would allow anyone to add in new data and/or control this visualization in concent with another type of visualization. An example would be someone could select a map area and then only show the points from within that map area on this plot. 

## Install (will build this out later)
- clone
- cd into repo
- If not already there, install python 3, pandas, jupyter, plotly
- in terminal, type       jupyter notebook
- place play to move through notebook and run cells
- play around with pink "brush"
