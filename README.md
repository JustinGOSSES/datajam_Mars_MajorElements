## What 
Major element data from all ChemCam rock sample data from start of MarsScienceLaboratory (Curiosity Rover) till today.

The pink bits on the image above are dragable and expandable "brushes". The samples "brushed" are colored but the ones that are not appear gray. This provides a way to see clusters within the whole, which is messy.
